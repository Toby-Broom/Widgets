# Shell Scripts for Linux

These are the files to create the xml file with the system data in

## Setup

I put the files in my home directly and share a folder from there with the xml file in.

You need to install [turbostat](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/tools/power/x86/turbostat), [tuptime](https://github.com/rfrail3/tuptime), nvidia drivers for nvidia-smi

`sudo apt install linux-tools-common`

`sudo apt install tuptime`
