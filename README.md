# Widgets
My personal widgets base on the work of @tjmarkham at https://github.com/tjmarkham/win10widgets

I use these widget to see the staus of the computers in my house from my main PC

## Design
I wanted to see the status of my computers on the desktop and liked the visual style that TJ Markham had used, so I cloned the style and edited to my requirements

It seemed challanging to get the data that I wanted remotley and I wanted some robustness when a computer was off or rebooting so I split the code in to the rainmeter parts and some PowerShell or Bash for the collection of data
